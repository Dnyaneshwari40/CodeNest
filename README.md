**Overview**

CodeNest is a MERN-stack based web application that combines a real-time text editor and a drawing canvas, offering an intuitive dual-interface workspace. It allows users to write and edit code or notes while simultaneously sketching diagrams or visual elements. With a toggle-based layout and responsive design, CodeNest is ideal for developers, educators, and creatives looking for an all-in-one sandbox environment.
The platform is lightweight, modular, and easy to extend for more advanced features such as saving content, collaboration, or cloud sync.
